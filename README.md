# üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the Bing Image Scraper, a tool updated and maintained by Ultralytics. This repository provides enhanced code, originally based on the [google-images-download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download) project by hardikvasa, specifically adapted for scraping images from Bing. It allows users to efficiently download images for various purposes, such as building datasets for [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml), performing [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis), or curating collections for personal projects.

## üê≥ Docker Run

For easy deployment using Docker, visit the dedicated GitHub repository: [google-images-download-by-docker](https://github.com/SaitamaTechno/google-images-download-by-docker).

You can run the scraper within a Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name image_searcher saitamatechno/google_images_download:v1.0
```

## üìã Requirements

To use this software effectively, please ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or later installed. You also need to install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which includes libraries like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/). Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can find the `requirements.txt` file [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/google-images-download/blob/main/requirements.txt).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the Bing image scraper on your local machine, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/google-images-download
cd google-images-download
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

Follow these steps to run the image scraper:

1.  **Install Google Chrome**: Ensure Google Chrome is installed on your system. If not, download it from the official [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
2.  **Download ChromeDriver**: Get the correct version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed Chrome version. Download links and instructions are available on the [ChromeDriver documentation page](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/). Make sure to note the path to the downloaded `chromedriver` executable.
3.  **Execute the Script**: Run the `bing_scraper.py` script using Python. You can specify a Bing Images search results URL using the `--url` argument or provide search terms directly with the `--search` argument. Images will be saved to the `./images` directory by default. The script is designed to skip images that cause errors during download. For insights into data collection best practices, check out our blog post on [exploring data labeling](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/exploring-data-labeling-for-computer-vision-projects).

**Example using a URL:**

```bash
python3 bing_scraper.py --url 'https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=wildflowers' --limit 20 --download --chromedriver /path/to/your/chromedriver
```

**Example using search terms:**

```bash
python3 bing_scraper.py --search 'bees collecting pollen' --limit 15 --download --chromedriver /path/to/your/chromedriver

# Output logs will show download progress and any encountered errors.
```

The downloaded images can be useful for creating custom [computer vision datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/).
