# üöÄ Introduction

This repository contains a versatile Bing image-scraping tool adapted from [this original project](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download). The Ultralytics team has enhanced it for improved functionality.

# üìã Requirements

To use this image scraper, you need Python 3.8 or later. Ensure all dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ultralytics/google-images-download/blob/master/requirements.txt) are installed. `selenium` is one such required package. To install all necessary packages, execute the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# üíæ Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages with these commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/google-images-download
$ cd google-images-download
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run the Scraper

To get started with the image scraper, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed. If not, download it here: https://www.google.com/chrome/

2. You need a compatible version of Chromedriver. Download it here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

3. Time to run the scraper! You can download up to `--limit` number of images. Use the `--url` flag if you have a specific webpage or the `--search` flag for terms you wish to query. The images will be saved in the `./images` directory. 

Download images from a URL:

```bash
$ python3 bing_scraper.py --url 'https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=flowers' --limit 10 --download --chromedriver /path/to/your/chromedriver
```

or using search terms:

```bash
$ python3 bing_scraper.py --search 'honeybees on flowers' --limit 10 --download --chromedriver /path/to/your/chromedriver

# You will see output similar to the following, which indicates the progress of the download.
```

Please note: Images that cause errors during download may be automatically skipped to ensure a smooth scraping process.
